Hi Jaswant/ Sravani – Request you to start joining DTP calls and report your work assignments & its progressive update with SM on regular basics. We understand Venkat/ Gowri usually assign work but still you need to join these common ceremonies along with other team members and report progress.

 

Let us know for any issues or difficulties. Also can you talk to Gowri and acknowledge on your planned development work for current sprint. We’re not seeing healthy assignment on Jira. Kindly update prior to tomorrow’s morning DTP. Thanks

 

ER 24.10 – Commitment Summery (as of 16th July EOD)
